    "In this lab you will start with the raw [Women's Clothing Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/nicapotato/womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews) dataset and prepare it to train a BERT-based natural language processing (NLP) model. The model will be used to classify customer reviews into positive (1), neutral (0) and negative (-1) sentiment.\n",

    "You will convert the original review text into machine-readable features used by BERT. To perform the required feature transformation you will configure an Amazon SageMaker processing job, which will be running a custom Python script.\n",
